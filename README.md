# RP2040-Macro-pad
A 3x4 Hot Swappable Macro pad with a custom PCB

I'm working on the schematic and Layout now, this is my first board with a microcontroller implemented directly on the PCB!

I chose the RP2040 for the job as it is documented extensively and generally easy to get booting. 

Some awesome resources I have been using for those who wish to do something similar:

I am planning on using QMK to set up the keyboard matrix later down the line.

I will be updating this to post the schematics and layout once I have completed a design review.

Here is a sneak peek of the pcb!
