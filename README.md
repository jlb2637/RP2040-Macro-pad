# RP2040-Macro-pad
A 3x4 Hot Swappable Macro pad with a custom PCB, running on QMK

This is my first board with a microcontroller implemented directly on the PCB!
I chose the RP2040 for the job as it is documented extensively and generally easy to get booting.

Some awesome resources I have been using for those who wish to do something similar:

QMK was used to write the software as it is the primary system used for custom control surfaces.

## QMK Software

## 3D-Printed Enclosure

### Tasks 
- [ ] pull pcb cad from old laptop to post final revisions here
- [ ] come up with more uses for the remaining buttons
- [ ] learn QMK layers
- [ ] use QMK layers to set up a MIDI layer
- [ ] refine 3D Printed enclosure and keycaps
